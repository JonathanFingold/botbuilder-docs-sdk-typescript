      Implement support for named actions which can be bound to a dialog to
      handle global utterances from the user like "help" or

      "cancel". Actions get pushed onto and off of the dialog stack as part of
      dialogs so these listeners can

      come into and out of scope as the conversation progresses. You can also
      bind named to actions to buttons

      which let your bot respond to button clicks on cards that have maybe
      scrolled off the screen.

      Called once for each dialog within a library to give the dialog a chance
      to add its

      `triggerAction()` to the libraries global action set.  These triggers get
      mapped to

      a `beginDialogAction()` that starts the dialog when the trigger condition
      is met.
