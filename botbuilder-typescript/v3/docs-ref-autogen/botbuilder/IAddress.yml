      Address routing information for an
      [event](/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/interfaces/_botbuilder_d_.ievent.html#address).

      Addresses are bidirectional meaning they can be used to address both
      incoming and outgoing events.

      They're also connector specific meaning that
      [connectors](/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/interfaces/_botbuilder_d_.iconnector.html)

      are free to add their own fields to the address.

      To send a __proactive message__ to a user bots should save the address
      from a received
      [message](/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/interfaces/_botbuilder_d_.imessage).

      Depending on the channel addresses can change, so bots should periodically
      update the address stored for a given

      user.
