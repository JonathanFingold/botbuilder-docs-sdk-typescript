      Allows for the creation of custom dialogs that are based on a simple
      closure. This is useful for

      cases where you want a dynamic conversation flow or you have a situation
      that just doesnâ€™t map

      very well to using a waterfall.  The things to keep in mind:

      * Your dialogs closure is can get called in two different contexts that
      you potentially need to
        test for. It will get called as expected when the user send your dialog a message but if you
        call another prompt or dialog from your closure it will get called a second time with the
        results from the prompt/dialog. You can typically test for this second case by checking for the
        existant of an `args.resumed` property. It's important to avoid getting yourself into an
        infinite loop which can be easy to do.
      * Unlike a waterfall your dialog will not automatically end. It will
      remain the active dialog
        until you call [session.endDialog()](/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/classes/_botbuilder_d_.session.html#enddialog).
