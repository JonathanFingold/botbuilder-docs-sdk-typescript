    summary: >-
      Sends outgoing message(s) to a user. This method will ultimately get
      called anytime you call

      [UniversalBot.send()](/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/classes/_botbuilder_d_.universalbot#send)
      or
      [Session.send()](/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/classes/_botbuilder_d_.session#send).

      You can manually call this method using `session.connector.send()` as a
      convenient way of

      getting the address of the message that was sent. You can then store this
      address and use

      it at a later point in time to either update or delete the message. The
      one thing to keep

      in mind is that if you manually call `session.connector.send()` you will
      bypass any

      middleware that the outgoing message would normally run through. Calling

      `session.send(msg).sendBatch(function (err, addresses) { })` does the same
      thing but ensures

      that the outgoing message is sent through middleware.

      [UniversalBot.beginDialog()](/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/classes/_botbuilder_d_.universalbot#begindialog)
