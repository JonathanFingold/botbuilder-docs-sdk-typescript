      Many messaging channels provide the ability to attach richer objects. Bot
      Builder lets you express these attachments in a cross channel way and
      [connectors](/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/interfaces/_botbuilder_d_.iconnector.html)
      will do their best to render the

      attachments using the channels native constructs. If you desire more
      control over the channels rendering of a message you can use
      [IEvent.sourceEvent](/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/interfaces/_botbuilder_d_.ievent.html#sourceevent)
      to provide attachments using

      the channels native schema. The types of attachments that can be sent
      varies by channel but these are the basic types:

      * __Media and Files:__  Basic files can be sent by setting
      [contentType](#contenttype) to the MIME type of the file and then passing
      a link to the file in [contentUrl](#contenturl).

      * __Cards:__  A rich set of visual cards can by setting
      [contentType](#contenttype) to the cards type and then passing the JSON
      for the card in [content](#content). If you use one of the rich card
      builder classes like

      [HeroCard](/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/classes/_botbuilder_d_.herocard.html)
      the attachment will automatically filled in for you.
