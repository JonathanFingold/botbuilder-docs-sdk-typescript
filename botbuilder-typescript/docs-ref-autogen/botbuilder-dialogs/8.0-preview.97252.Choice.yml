    summary: >-
      An instance of a choice that can be used to render a choice to a user or
      recognize something a

      user picked.
    package: botbuilder-dialogs - v4
    remarks: >-
      The [value](#value) will be rendered to a user unless an [action](#action)
      is provided in which

      case the actions `title` will be rendered to the user.


      At recognition time the `value` will always be what gets returned by
      `findChoices()` and

      `recognizeChoices()`. By default, the users utterance will be compared
      against all of the

      strings provided in the choice. You can disable using the `value` and/or
      `action.title` during

      recognition using the `FindChoicesOptions` structure.


      ```JavaScript

      const choice = {
          value: 'red',
          action: {
              type: 'imBack',
              title: 'The Red Pill',
              value: 'red pill'
          },
          synonyms: ['crimson', 'scarlet', 'ruby', 'cherry']
      };

      ```
