      Each conversation your bot has with a user or group will have its own
      isolated storage object

      that can be used to persist conversation tracking information between
      turns of the conversation.

      This state information can be reset at any point by calling
      [clear()](#clear).


      ```JavaScript

      const { ConversationState, MemoryStorage } = require('botbuilder');


      const conversationState = new ConversationState(new MemoryStorage());

      ```
